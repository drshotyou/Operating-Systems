HELLO TA, Two things I want to clarify.
First, task3.cpp is my actual solution, Os_fake_sol is the originalfile, to avoid confusions.
Two, My Os_fake_judge.cpp should do what the actual solution does if I am not mistaken (choosing 0,1 or 2 randomly). I will include the original Fake judge as OG_Os_fake_judge.cpp.
Thanks!
